## Project Description 📜

The project consists of two HTML pages: `index.html` and `index2.html`. It enables users to check their friendship percentage by entering their names and calculates the result. However, both pages require improvements in terms of styling and responsiveness.

## Styling and Responsiveness 🎨

### For index.html 🖼️

#### Problem ❗
The styling of the `index.html` page can be improved for better visual appeal and readability.

#### Solution ✅
1. **CSS Styles**: Create a CSS file (e.g., `style.css`) to enhance the styling of `index.html`. Adjust font sizes, colors, and background to improve the visual aesthetics.

2. **Background Image**: Consider adding a background image to the `body` for a more visually appealing design. Ensure the image is responsive and appropriately sized.

3. **Text and Content**: Review and update the text content, font styles, and text alignment to enhance the visual appeal and readability.

### For index2.html 🖼️

#### Problem ❗
The `index2.html` page also requires better styling, and the alignment of input fields and labels needs improvement.

#### Solution ✅
1. **CSS Styles**: Create a CSS file (e.g., `style2.css`) for `index2.html` to add styles. Adjust font sizes, colors, and background colors for text inputs and labels.

2. **Background Image**: Similar to `index.html`, consider adding a responsive background image to the `body` for improved visual appeal.

3. **Text Alignment**: Adjust the alignment of labels (`label1` and `label2`) and center the text inputs for a more appealing layout.
